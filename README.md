Description:
Weather app was built to display current and future weater data.
Data was obtained from https://openweathermap.org/api using the 5 day / 3 hour Forecast api.
This data pulls a total of 40 items and in ordert to get the daily data increments of 8 hours were used with data starting at 3 hurs to get data from the middle of the day.

How the it works:
In order to pull data you must type in a city name in the input field and then must click search.
As you search for a different city the last entry gets logged into a list.
